/**
 * quote from MODBUS Application Protocol Specification V1.1b
 * <p>
 * "The data address received in the query is not an
 * allowable address for the server (or slave). More
 * specifically, the combination of reference number
 * and transfer length is invalid. For a controller with
 * 100 registers, the PDU addresses the first
 * register as 0, and the last one as 99. If a request
 * is submitted with a starting register address of 96
 * and a quantity of registers of 4, then this request
 * will successfully operate (address-wise at least)
 * on registers 96, 97, 98, 99. If a request is
 * submitted with a starting register address of 96
 * and a quantity of registers of 5, then this request
 * will fail with Exception Code 0x02 “Illegal Data
 * Address” since it attempts to operate on registers
 * 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100, and there is no register
 * with address 100."
